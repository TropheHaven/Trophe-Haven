                Vietnamese quẩy is a deep-fried snack which was inspired by youtiao, a popular Chinese delicacy. Although very similar in preparation and shape to its more popular cousin, quẩy is regarded as a national culinary treasure in Vietnam. Plain flour, leavening agents, salt, water, and sugar create the basic dough, which is left to rest for hours until ready. The snack is created by combining two pieces of dough which are shortly deep-fried until golden brown. The lengthy preparation procedure should result in a delicacy which puffs in contact with oil and slightly separates to resemble two individual sticks that are connected in the middle.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>500 g all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
                    <li>250-300 ml water</li>
                    <li>5 g baking powder</li>
                    <li>10 g baking soda</li>
                    <li>oil, for frying</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <strong>Directions: </strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place baking powder and baking soda in two separate bowls. Add 50 ml (about 3 tbsp) water to each bowl and combine.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, sugar, dissolved baking powder, dissolved baking soda, and the remaining water. Mix well with a spatula, so the liquid is fully absorbed.</li>
                    <li>Knead the dough with your hands or with an electric mixer equipped with kneading paddles for 1-2 minutes. Do not over-knead the dough: the surface of the dough should be rough rather than smooth.</li>
                    <li>Cover the dough with a wet kitchen cloth or with a piece of plastic wrap and let it rest for 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>After that, knead the dough for another 1-2 minutes, and let it rest for 20 more minutes.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the process until the dough has been kneaded 3 times.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the dough onto a working surface, knead it briefly, then roll it out into a flat disc 1-1,5 cm thick.</li>
                    <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 2,5-4 hours.</li>
                    <li>After that, remove the cover and roll out the dough, so it is 1/2 cm thick.</li>
                    <li>Cut the dough into 7,5-10 cm wide bands. Then, cut each band into smaller, 2,5 cm wide strips. You will get small rectangles of dough measuring 2,5x7,5 cm or 2,5x10 cm.</li>
                    <li>Dip a bamboo stick in water and press it down into the middle of dough rectangles, so you get a shallow dent lengthwise. Do this with only half of the dough rectangles.</li>
                    <li>Place the undented dough rectangles on top of the dented ones. Now, make a dent on top using the same technique.</li>
                    <li>In a large wok, heat the oil to 180˚C. Make sure the oil is at least 5 cm deep.</li>
                    <li>Stretch each quẩy gently, then drop them in hot oil. Flip them constantly with chopsticks or kitchen tongs, until they expand and become golden. If the first few quẩys don’t expand during baking, let the dough rest for a little while more.</li>
                    <li>After frying, drain quẩy on paper towels or a wire rack. Well-fried quẩy should be crispy on the outside and hollow on the inside.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot with rice porridge or dip it in noodle soups such as pho or banh canh.</li>
                </ol>
