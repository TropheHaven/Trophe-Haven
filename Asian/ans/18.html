                Kachori is a spicy Indian snack shaped like a round flattened ball, consisting of a flour-based shell with different fillings. The most popular filling consists of yellow moong dal, besan flour, pepper, chili powder, cumin seeds, and other spices. Kachori is most popular in Indian states such as Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Punjab. The snack has numerous variations in each state, so dried fruits, nuts, and coconut are sometimes added to kachori in order to enhance its flavors. In Delhi, it is typically served with curd, tamarind chutney, and onion rings.

                    <li>salt as required</li>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Other Ingredients</strong>
                    <li>oil for deep frying, as required</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <strong>Directions: </strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take 2 cups all purpose flour (maida) and salt in a bowl or pan. Mix very well.</li>
                    <li>Add ¼ cup ghee. Ensure the ghee is in a semi-solid flowing state and not hard.</li>
                    <li>With your fingertips mix the ghee evenly with the flour for a few minutes till you get a breadcrumb like texture in the mixture.</li>
                    <li>Add water in portions. Mix first and then knead to smooth dough that is semi-soft or soft. Do not make the dough too soft.</li>
                    <li>Cover the dough with a moist muslin or kitchen cotton towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Rinse ½ cup moong dal in a bowl. Soak moong dal with enough water for 2 hours.</li>
                    <li>Later drain all the water very well and add the soaked moong lentils in a grinder jar.</li>
                    <li>Grind to a roughly coarse mixture without adding any water.</li>
                    <li>Heat a frying pan or sauté pan. Add ½ tablespoon ghee.</li>
                    <li>Once the ghee melts, keep the heat to the lowest or turn off the flame.</li>
                    <li>Add all the spice powders one by one.</li>
                    <li>Keep the heat to its lowest and mix very well. Do make sure that the ground spices do not burn.</li>
                    <li>Then add the coarsely ground moong dal. Also add salt and 1 pinch of asafoetida.</li>
                    <li>On a low heat mix very well.</li>
                    <li>Saute with non-stop stirring for 3 to 4 minutes on a low heat.</li>
                    <li>Check the taste and if required you can add more spice powders like red chili powder and mango powder or salt. Let the mixture become warm or cool down.</li>
                    <li>Now make small balls from this moong dal mixture. You can also spread some oil on your palms while making the balls. Keep aside.</li>
                    <li>After 30 minutes, lightly knead the dough.</li>
                    <li>Roll the dough into a log. Now cut the dough in equal portions. This will depend on the number of moong dal mixture balls that were made.</li>
                    <li>Take a portion of the cut dough. Roll to a neat ball and then flatten it with your fingers. Keep the edges thin while flattening. You can also use a rolling pin to flatten.</li>
                    <li>Now place the moong dal stuffing ball on the dough. Flatten the moong dal stuffing ball gently by pressing it.</li>
                    <li>Bring the edges of the dough together and join them at the center. Excess dough can be pinched off and removed.</li>
                    <li>Flatten the top and then gently roll the kachori with a rolling pin to get a medium thick kachori.</li>
                    <li>Stuff and prepare all kachori this way. Keep them covered under a moist muslin or cotton cloth, so that they do not dry up.</li>
                    <li>Heat oil for frying in a kadai (wok). Keep the heat to a low or medium-low. When the oil is just hot enough, you can add 2 to 3 kachoris or more depending on the size of the kadai.</li>
                    <li>When the kachori start puffing up, then gently nudge each kachori with a slotted spoon, so that they puff up well.</li>
                    <li>When the base becomes light golden, then gently turn them over. The frying takes about 7 to 9 minutes. So one has to be patient.</li>
                    <li>Continue to fry on a low to medium-low heat till they become golden. While frying you can turn them often to get an even color.</li>
                    <li>Regulate the temperature from low to medium-low as required.</li>
                    <li>Fry till they become golden and nicely crisp from outside. Once the kachoris are fried well, the oil will also stop sizzling.</li>
                    <li>Remove with a slotted spoon and place Khasta Kachori on kitchen paper towels so that excess oil is absorbed. Fry the remaining kachoris in batches this way.</li>
                    <li>Serve Khasta Kachori warm accompanied with some fried & salted green chilies, tamarind chutney and green chutney. You can also serve them with chili garlic chutney or sweetened curd (yogurt).</li>
