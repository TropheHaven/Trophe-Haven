                The famous Iranian tahchin is a savory rice delicacy resembling a cake or a casserole. The dish is made with precooked rice which is spiced with saffron, layered in a pan, then baked. After it has been baked, this rice casserole is turned upside down and cut into pieces. The dish is usually improved by the addition of meat or vegetables, which are layered between the rice. However, it can also be baked without any additional fillings. Numerous tahchin varieties can be found all over Iran in many traditional Iranian restaurants or at popular bazaars.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
                    <li>2 egg yolks</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup dried barberries</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon rose water (optional)</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup oil</li>
                    <li>4 tablespoons bloomed saffron</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric</li>
                    <li>Salt and pepper as needed</li>
                    <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
                    <li>1 boneless chicken breast</li>
                    <li>1 large onion</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoon slivered almonds(optional)</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoon slivered pistachios(optional)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <strong>Directions: </strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Rinse rice until the water is clear. Soak rice in a large bowl of water. Add 1 tablespoon salt and stir to dissolve. Let it sit for 2 hours.</li>
                    <li>Soak slivered pistachios and almonds in cold water for 30 minutes, drain, and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Rinse the barberries with cold water to remove any dirt or debris. Drain, and set aside. Put 2 tablespoons of butter or vegetable oil in a small frying pan on medium heat. Add barberries, slivered pistachios, and almonds to the pan and saute for 1 or 2 minutes. Set them aside. Keep an eye on barberries as they will burn easily.</li>
                    <li>Using a mortar and pestle, grind down the saffron threads. Sprinkle ground saffron on 3 tablespoons of boiling water and set aside for at least 10-15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Season chicken pieces with salt, turmeric, and black pepper and place in a pot. Add sliced onion and a cinnamon stick. Add water to cover the chicken pieces and bring to a boil. Skim off any foam, reduce heat, and simmer over low heat until chicken pieces are fork-tender and fully cooked. Shred cooked chicken pieces with a fork and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Drain the soaked rice. Add fresh water into a pot. For every cup of rice add two cups of water. Place the pot on the stove over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Add 1 tablespoon of salt to the boiling water.</li>
                    <li>Add drained rice to the pot of boiling water and give a quick stir. The rice is done after 8-10 minutes when it begins to rise to the top and the water comes back to a boil. Check the rice is cooked by trying a grain.</li>
                    <li>Break one grain in half. Rice should be soft on the outside but slightly hard in the middle. Pour rice into the colander to drain; then set aside.</li>
                    <li>In a bowl, mix together the yogurt, egg yolks, rose water, and bloomed saffron. Add 1/2 rice to the yogurt mixture and mix it well.</li>
                    <li>Add 3 tablespoons of oil to the rice cooker or a non-stick pot. The pot should be non-stick so that you can flip the rice cake easily without having to worry about the crust sticking to the bottom.</li>
                    <li>Pour the saffron rice mixture into the pan. Flatten the first layer with a spoon, layer chicken pieces, and then cover the entire surface with remaining plain rice. Flatten the rice and press it with the back of a spoon.</li>
                    <li>Place the pot on medium-high heat directly on the stovetop. Cover the lid with a clean dishcloth and put it on the pot. Cook over medium heat until the rice begins to steam. Then lower the heat and cook for about 40-45 minutes or until the crust forms.</li>
                    <li>When the rice is cooked and the crust is golden and crispy, turn off the heat and let it sit for 5 minutes. Find a serving platter or dish large enough to hold the Tahchin. Cover the pot with the platter, hold them together firmly, and invert Tahchin onto your platter.</li>
                    <li>Serve Tahchin with sauteed barberries, slivered pistachios, and almonds on top.</li>
