                Tonkotsu is a unique style of ramen consisting of an extremely rich, fatty pork broth, fresh noodles, soft-yolk eggs, and tender pork belly that melts in the mouth. It is so popular and special that it could be a dish of its own, not just a ramen style. The ramen is usually topped with scallions for brightness and vibrancy, bamboo shoots for a crunchy, nutty flavor, nori seaweed for crispness, and sweet corn for an even better flavor. The rich broth is developed by cooking the pork bones for a very long time, until the collagen and fat dissolve, resulting in a unique, creamy texture of the dish.

                </ul>
                <br>
                <strong>Directions: </strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Roll the pork belly into a log (with skin on the outside), then tie it with kitchen twine, which will prevent it from falling apart during cooking.</li>
                    <li>Set the oven to preheat to 275°F/140°C.</li>
                    <li>Add all the remaining ingredients, plus one cup of water, to a Dutch oven, then submerge the pork log into the liquid. Cover with a lid but not completely. Place in a preheated oven and cook for 3-4 hours.</li>
                    <li>When done, transfer to a new pot, then cover it, and when at room temperature, refrigerate until cooled.</li>
                    <li>Strain the liquid and reserve for the ramen eggs, remove the twine, then thinly slice.</li>
                    <li>Before serving, reheat the slices of chashu in a little broth.</li>
                    <li>Add garlic and canola oil to a pot, then simmer over low heat for 10 minutes, constantly stirring until blackened.</li>
                    <li>Transfer into a blender, add sesame oil, then whiz for approximately 30 seconds, so the garlic completely disintegrates.</li>
                    <li>Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to two months.</li>
                    <li>Cook chicken and pork bones in a pot of cold water until boiling, then take off the stove.</li>
                    <li>Throw away the water and wash the bones under cold running water, removing all the blackened dirt and scum, and marrow on the outside and inside of bones, so they are spotless and white/grey.</li>
                    <li>Grill the onion, the garlic, and the ginger for 15 minutes in an oiled pan, stirring often.</li>
                    <li>Add the bones, the grilled vegetables, the pork fatback, the mushrooms, the leeks, the scallions, and the cold water into a pot, taking care that the bones and the vegetables are covered by about two inches (5 cm) of water.</li>
                    <li>Cook over high heat until the water reaches a rolling boil. If any scum starts appearing, remove it, and also clean the inside sides of the bowl from any scum.</li>
                    <li>When there is no more scum appearing on the surface, lower the heat to a mild simmer, then cover the pot with a lid.</li>
                    <li>Cook for about 4 hours until the fatback is cooked, then take the fatback from the pot and place it in a sealable container and refrigerate until later.</li>
                    <li>Continue to cook for 6-8 hours, adding more water if needed to cover the bones and the vegetables.</li>
                    <li>When the broth is done, turn up the heat to bring the broth to a boil. Let it boil until it reduces to 3 quarts (2.8 L).</li>
                    <li>Throw away the solids, and filter the broth using a fine-mesh sieve.</li>
                    <li>Finely dice the fatback and stir it into the broth.</li>
                    <li>First, pierce both ends of each egg with a small needle, so they do not crack during cooking.</li>
                    <li>Place the eggs in boiling water, lower the heat to a simmer, and cook for about 6 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Place the eggs in an ice bath for a few minutes, then peel them.</li>
                    <li>Put the peeled eggs in the container with the chashu pork marinade, and cover it with a cheesecloth.</li>
                    <li>Refrigerate for up to 12 hours. The ramen eggs can keep for up to 3 days in the refrigerator.</li>
                    <li>Cook each portion of noodles separately.</li>
                    <li>First, for each portion, heat a liter (4 cups) of water to a rolling boil, then place the noodles in the water and cook according to instructions on the packaging, stirring with chopsticks or thongs, so noodles do not stick.</li>
                    <li>Divide the broth between 6 bowls, then season it with the mayu sauce according to taste.</li>
                    <li>Add the noodles, stir, and top with slices of chashu pork and chopped green parts of the scallions.</li>
                    <li>If making the ramen egg, slice each in half lengthwise, then place two halves in every bowl.</li>
