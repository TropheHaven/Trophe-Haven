                Kubaneh is a popular Yemeni-Jewish bread consisting of flour, sugar, salt, and butter. It is traditionally served warm for breakfast. The bread comes in two varieties: folded (the dough is shaped into balls, combined with butter, and rolled in a spiral) and monkey bread (balls of dough are dipped in butter and placed in the pan).

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>16 tablespoons (227g) unsalted butter, cold</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup + 1 tablespoon (184g) water</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup (57g) milk, whole preferred</li>
                    <li>1 large egg</li>
                    <li>3 3/4 cups (450g) All-Purpose Flour</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons instant yeast or active dry yeast</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup (99g) granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon (6g) table salt</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <strong>Directions: </strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>To brown the butter: Have a clean, fine-mesh strainer and heatproof bowl on hand. Place the butter in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat until melted.</li>
                    <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the butter separates and the solids start to smell nutty and turn brown, like the color of maple syrup (about 5 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Strain the butter into the bowl, discarding the strained solids, and set it aside to cool to room temperature.</li>
                    <li>To make the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle, combine the water, milk, and egg. Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Add the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt. Mix on medium speed until a soft dough begins to form.</li>
                    <li>Scrape the bowl, switch to the dough hook, and continue to knead for 8 to 10 minutes. The dough should be soft and stretchy.</li>
                    <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead briefly by hand into a smooth ball. Place in a greased bowl, cover, and let rest at room temperature for 1 1/2 hours.</li>
                    <li>Lightly flour your work surface. Turn the dough out and press it into a rectangle. Divide it into eight portions, each weighing 3 3/4 to 4 ounces.</li>
                    <li>Shape each piece into a ball. Brush the tops with some of the browned butter and place on a buttered piece of parchment.</li>
                    <li>Cover and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Brush the inside of a 9" springform pan with browned butter.</li>
                    <li>Generously brush a second sheet of parchment with browned butter. Place a ball of dough on the buttered parchment and brush the top with more browned butter. Use your hands to flatten and carefully stretch it out to a 10" square. Don't worry about tearing the dough (it will end up on the inside).</li>
                    <li>Brush more browned butter over the square, then fold the right side over to the center. Fold the left side over the top, making a trifold (letter fold). Brush with more butter and roll the rectangle up into a sausage shape, starting with the short side closest to you.</li>
                    <li>Place seam side down on the first piece of parchment. Repeat with the remaining balls of dough.</li>
                    <li>Using a sharp knife, cut each roll in half across the middle and place, cut side down, in the prepared pan. Place 10 coils around the outside of the pan, a ring of five more inside those coils, and the last one in the center. Cover the pan and let rise at room temperature for 45 minutes, until puffy-looking.</li>
                    <li>Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
                    <li>Place the springform pan on a rimmed baking sheet and bake the rolls for 30 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 325°F and continue baking for 10 or 15 minutes more. Check between the coils for doneness.</li>
                    <li>Remove the rolls from the oven and brush them with more browned butter.</li>
                    <li>Let the rolls cool completely before removing from the pan to serve.</li>
                    <li>Store rolls, covered, on the counter for up to three days; freeze for longer storage.</li>
                </ol>
