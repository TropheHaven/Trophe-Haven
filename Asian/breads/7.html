                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>¾ cup 180 ml whole milk 110°F or 43°C</li>
                    <li>1 ½ teaspoon (6 g) active dry yeast or instant yeast</li>
                    <li>2 cups (300 g) all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>¾ cup (100 g) wheat starch</li>
                    <li>½ cup (70 g) powdered sugar</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoon (10 g) baking powder</li>
                    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon (15 g) vegetable shortening</li>
                    <li>1 large egg white room temperature</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon (15 g) vegetable oil</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <strong>Directions: </strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare the yeast. Warm the milk to 110°F or 43°C. Add active dry yeast. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 10 min. If using instant yeast, let sit for 2-3 minutes to double check if the yeast is active. The yeast will create a frothy, ¼ inch foam layer at the top if it is active.</li>
                    <li>Sift the dry ingredients. Sift flour, wheat starch, powdered sugar, baking powder and salt into the bowl of your stand mixer with a dough attachment. Mix together on low.</li>
                    <li>Add in the shortening while mixer is mixing on low. Make sure the shortening is broken up into small pieces by feeling it with your hand.</li>
                    <li>Liquify the egg in oil. In another separate bowl, combine the room temperature egg white with vegetable oil. Liquify the egg by pulling up the egg white with a fork a few times until combined.</li>
                    <li>Knead all the mixtures together. While the stand mixer is on low, mix the yeast milk mixture and then add the egg and oil mix for 30 seconds. Once combined, increase the speed to medium (level 4) and knead for 5 minutes or until it forms into a ball in the mixer and is no longer sticking to the bowl. The dough should be tacky but not overly sticky. If it is too dry, add 1 tablespoon of water and combine. If the dough is too sticky, add 1 tablespoon of flour and combine.</li>
                    <li>Knead the dough into a ball with your hands. Knead the dough into a smooth ball with your hands for 1 minute and transfer it into a lightly greased large bowl.</li>
                    <li>Proof the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm area (100°F or 37°C) for about 1-2 hours or until double in size. This dough has more moisture from the fat in it so it may take awhile to rise.</li>
                    <li>Divide and roll out the dough. Divide into 10-12 equal pieces depending on how big you want them and quickly roll them into smooth balls. Make sure to not over handle them, they may turn out tougher if you do.</li>
                    <li>Let the buns rest. Place parchment squares or cupcake liners underneath each bun. Cover with a dish towel and let the buns rest for 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Steam the buns. Wrap the lid of your steamer with a dish cloth to prevent the condensation from falling into your steamer. Add water to your steamer and bring the water to a boil. Place the buns 2 inches apart in your steamer, cover and steam on medium heat for 10-12 minutes. After steaming, leave the buns to sit in the steamer for 1 minute to prevent them from wrinkling from the temperature shock. You will have to steam the buns in 2-3 batches depending on the size of your steamer. Cover the uncooked buns with plastic wrap and place them in the refrigerator to slow down the yeast activity until they are ready to be steamed.</li>
                    <li>Serve immediately when hot.</li>
