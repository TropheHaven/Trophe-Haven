                Shao bing is a popular street and breakfast food in Northern China and Taiwan. Traditionally, this Chinese flatbread recipe is baked, unleavened (no yeast, baking powder, or baking soda), and layered. Because it is plain bread, it can be enjoyed alone or with fillings. Shao bing is also enjoyed with other breakfast classics such as salted soy milk and Chinese crackers.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>3.25 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>⅔ cup boiling water</li>
                    <li>⅓ cup cold water</li>
                    <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
                    <li>¼ cup room temperature water</li>
                    <li>¼ cup toasted sesame seeds</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <strong>Directions: </strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven and prepare pan, line a sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>Prepare Roux, Heat the oil in a small skillet over medium heat until the surface of the oil starts to shimmer. Add 1/4 cup of the flour and stir with a rubber spatula to combine. Reduce the heat to low. Cook, stirring constantly, until the roux turns light brown, about 3 minutes. Turn off heat and transfer roux to a small heatproof bowl. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Mix Dough, Place the remaining 3 cups flour in a second, large heatproof bowl. Stir in the boiling water, followed by the cold water. Bring the mixture together to form a ball. You can use your hands, but be careful because the dough will be hot.</li>
                    <li>Knead and Roll, Transfer to a floured counter and knead until smooth, about 2 minutes. Roll the dough out into a rectangle measuring roughly 12 by 18 inches.</li>
                    <li>Add Roux and Salt, If the roux has separated, stir it to combine. Brush about 1/4 cup of the roux on the dough, leaving about a 1/2-inch border on all sides. Sprinkle evenly with the salt.</li>
                    <li>Roll and Cut, Starting from one long side, roll the dough up into a long log. Pinch the seam to seal. Cut the log of dough into 8 even pieces.</li>
                    <li>Fold, Turn a piece of dough so that one cut side faces you. Roll out the dough into a rectangle measuring roughly 5 by 3 1/2 inches. Fold the rectangle into thirds, like a letter: start with the bottom and fold one-third of the way up. Then fold the top flap down to overlap with the bottom flap. Turn the folded dough 90 degrees so that the open edge is facing you. Roll the dough out again into a 5-by-3 1/2-inch rectangle. Repeat the letter folding step once more.</li>
                    <li>Add Water and Sesame Seeds, Brush the flat side of the dough with the room temperature water. Place the sesame seeds in a shallow bowl. Press the damp side of the dough into the sesame seeds to adhere. With the sesame side up and one open edge toward you, roll out the dough out once more into a 5-by-3-inch rectangle. Place on the prepared pan and repeat steps 7 and 8 with the remaining dough.</li>
                    <li>Bake, Transfer to the oven and bake until the shao bing puff, 10 to 15 minutes. Quickly and carefully flip the shao bing and continue to bake until golden brown spots appear, 3 to 4 more minutes.</li>
                    <li>Cool and Serve, Let the shao bing cool slightly before serving. You can eat them like toast and spread on some butter. Or you can serve them as part of a Chinese breakfast with warm soy milk, or with eggs. You can use them for sandwiches, too.</li>
