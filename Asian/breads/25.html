                Peshwari Naan (or Peshawari naan) is a leavened bread, filled with desiccated coconut, sultanas (or raisins), and almonds. It originates from the city of Peshawar in Pakistan. This sweet naan bread is usually smeared with melted butter or ghee after cooking. Some Indian restaurants also add almond flakes and sultanas to the naan and drizzle it with honey or syrup.

                <ul>
                    <li>For the Dough:</li>
                    <li>300ml (1 1/4 cup) milk</li>
                    <li>7g (1 tsp) dried yeast</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsp sugar</li>
                    <li>3 eggs</li>
                    <li>300ml (1 1/4 cup) Greek yogurt</li>
                    <li>900g plain white flour plus more for kneading and dusting</li>
                    <li>Scant 1 Tbsp salt</li>
                    <li>1 Tbsp baking powder</li>
                    <li>For the Peshwari Paste:</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons desiccated coconut</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon (more or less) sugar</li>
                    <li>200g almond flakes</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons single cream</li>
                    <li>20 sultanas</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon melted ghee</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp sesame seeds</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <strong>Directions: </strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat the milk in a jug in the microwave until it is hand hot. Stir in the yeast and sugar and cover with a cloth. Place in a warm place for 30 to 60 minutes to awaken the yeast. It will become quite frothy.</li>
                    <li>While the yeast is foaming up, whisk the eggs in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the yoghurt and whisk until</li>
                    <li>Smooth. Once the yeast has bubbled up, pour it all into the bowls with the eggs and yoghurt. Whisk again until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Now mix the baking powder and salt with the flour and sift half of it over the liquid mixture. You can mix this all by hand in the bowl or pour it all into a stand mixer as I did in the photos which is easier. At this point, the dough will be very wet. Add the remaining flour and knead into a soft dough.</li>
                    <li>The dough will be way to sticky to handle. Add just enough flour so that you can work it into a soft dough that is still quite sticky.</li>
                    <li>Knead this hard for about 5 minutes and then form into a large dough ball. Place the dough ball in a mixing bowl and cover. Allow to rise for a few hours or overnight.</li>
                    <li>Once the dough has risen, punch in down and knead for another few minutes. Then separate the stick dough into 8 to 10 smaller balls. The dough will still be quite sticky which is good. Now take each clump of dough and add just enough flour so that it is workable. It should be sticky but not sticking to your hands.</li>
                    <li>Repeat with the remaining dough. Cover the dough balls until ready to cook. Let these dough balls rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>In a food processor, blend the almond flakes, cream, desiccated coconut, sugar and sultanas until they form a thick paste. You may need to adjust the recipe by adding more cream to form the paste if it is too crumbly or more almond flakes if too wet.</li>
                    <li>Place all of the Peshwari paste ingredients in a food processor and blend to a thick paste.</li>
                    <li>Now take one of the dough balls and make a shallow hole in it with your thumb. Place the peshwari paste dough into it and then fold the naan dough around the peshwari paste. Roll out into a flat round or teardrop shaped disc. Slap the disc between your hands to get all the excel flour off.</li>
                    <li>(To Pan Fry) Heat a frying pan over high heat. When hot, place the naan disc on the pan and dry fry it for about two minutes. Bubbles should form on the top.</li>
                    <li>Turn the naan over to colour the top for about 30 seconds to a minute and then turn it over again until cooked through.</li>
                    <li>Brush with hot ghee and serve sprinkled with sesame seeds.</li>
                    <li>(To Bake) Pre-heat your oven to 250c/500f. If you have a pizza stone, use it. If not, you can cook these naans on a baking tray. Heat your pizza stone or baking tray for about 30 minutes and then place as many naans on it as you can.</li>
                    <li>Place in the oven and cook until golden brown and bubbly on top. This only takes about 10 minutes but cooking times will vary depending on the thickness of your Peshwari naans.</li>
