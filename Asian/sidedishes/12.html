                Bhortas or bhartas are a group of dishes mainly associated with Bangladesh. The group encompasses various combinations of mashed herbs, vegetables, or fish whose base typically combines mustard oil, garlic, onions, and red chili peppers. The most common ingredients used in bhortas include eggplants, potatoes, prawns, ilish and other types of fresh and dry fish, as well as numerous other vegetables and herbs. The ingredients can be steamed, grilled, or roasted before they are combined into a mash. Although they were invented among the Bengali Muslims, bhortas have become an indispensable part of national Bangladesh cuisine. They are served as a side dish or the main course, typically with rice on the side.

                </ul>
                <br>
                <strong>Directions: </strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make your pink-pickled onions as far in advance as you can: at least 2 hours, and up to 24. Cut your red onion half — or use a whole onion if you prefer, as you will easily find yourself adding them to much else — into fine half-moons. Put these into a jar with a lid, or simply into a bowl that you can cover. Pour over red wine vinegar (or lime juice), pressing down on the onions until they are all just immersed. Put the lid on the jar or cover your bowl, and leave the onions to steep.</li>
                    <li>When you’re ready to make and eat the bhorta, heat the oven to 220°C/200°C Fan/425°F. While you’re waiting, peel and slice your 2 regular onions into fine half-moons, deseed the chillies (or not if you prefer) and slice them finely, and peel the garlic. If the skin is tough, peel the ginger (using the tip of a teaspoon) then grate it finely to give 1 tablespoonful.</li>
                    <li>When the oven’s hot, and your ingredients are assembled and ready, put the frozen fish fingers on a baking sheet and cook for approx. 20–25 minutes, which may be slightly longer than the packet directs, but will ensure the breadcrumb coating is really crisp.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, warm the oil in a large frying pan (I use a wok-shaped stir-fry pan), and cook the onions over medium-low for 20 minutes, stirring regularly, by which time they will be pale gold and soft.</li>
                    <li>Add the sliced chillies and cook, stirring all the while, for 3 minutes, then stir in the grated ginger, mince or grate in the garlic, and cook, still stirring, for another 2 minutes. Spoon in the mustard and salt, stirring to combine, then add the spinach leaves and let them wilt in the pan for 2–3 minutes, stirring regularly, then squeeze in the juice of the lime.</li>
                    <li>Take the pan off the heat while you get the fish fingers. Break them up a bit with a spatula then add them to the wok or frying pan. Toss everything together, breaking them up further and mashing them into the pan, then sprinkle over the coriander.</li>
                    <li>Serve topped with the pink-pickled onions, adding extra chopped coriander if wished.</li>
                </ol>
